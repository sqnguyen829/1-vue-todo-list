Handling State(edit,delete,add), Event, Routes, methods, Props, exporting and import components, forms, accessing API, 

Using "created" which is similar to componentDidMount

Using/manipulating data from an API
Using axios, could just use fetch but for the sake of practice I use went with what the vid had done.

npm install axios

Vue Router, we can install through the terminal or using the vue UI(located in the Pugins, if router were to be added later it would overwrite whats in the App file). So make sure to move the code over to another location.

Files that are changed/added because of router:
views folder(added)
router.js(added)
App.vue(changed)
main.js(changed)

App Deployment
